<p>Today,most apps/online services still use centralized servers,which is really spendy,and it's ugly when it goes down.If you've made one,you'd know what I'm talking about.Refresh a list?Ask the server.Download a file?Server.Send a message?Server again.Ugh.<br>
But what else have we got?The answer is peer-to-peer.You've seen it in BitTorrrent,Gnutella.P2P can allow developers to build networks without centralized servers.
It has tons of advantages over centralized networks: <strong>Less building cost,Less maintenance cost,More dynamic,Harder to go down</strong> ,and more.</p>

<ul>
<li>For individual developers,it can save butt loads of money,allowing them to innovate better.</li>
<li>For enterprises,they can throw away those gigantic servers,and keep only one or two small servers.</li>
<li>For users,adopting RevS means they can use the online services even when the servers are down.Amazing.<br>
</li>
</ul><p>RevS can dramatically reduce the costs for online service developers.</p>

<p>Sure,there are other P2P implementations,but if you've seen one or two,you would know that they are complicated and sometimes specialized.You can't really figure out what you can actually do with them,and that's why a lot of programmers gave up P2P.
But not RevS.RevS offers a straight forward logic and an easy-to-use API that can surely change your idea about P2P programming.
And you can upload and download files just like interacting with a server.If you are familiar with building server based apps,you'd feel like you're home.</p>

<a name="your-own-implementation" class="anchor" href="#your-own-implementation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Your own implementation</h1>

<p>RevS now supports Objective-C.If you want to use RevS on other platforms,you can build your own implementation of RevS,using the language you prefer.View the <a href="https://github.com/theGreatLzbdd/RevS/wiki">Wiki Page</a> to learn more about the details of RevS.</p>

<a name="beyond" class="anchor" href="#beyond"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Beyond...</h1>

<p>Peer-to-peer isn't just all about logics and programming,it's also about freedom.Freedom from censorship,freedom from government-peeking,and freedom to say whatever you want.There are countries that still keep its people away from these freedoms,and the wide adoption of peer-to-peer networking will help their people to seek for their own freedom.</p>
