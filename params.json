{"name":"RevS","tagline":"RevS is an open source P2P library that allows developers to build Peer-to-Peer based online apps.","body":"##Wiki\r\n * [Using RevS in your app](https://github.com/theGreatLzbdd/RevS/wiki/Guide-of-using-RevS-in-your-app)\r\n * [How does RevS work](https://github.com/theGreatLzbdd/RevS/wiki/How-does-RevS-work)\r\n\r\n##Test Apps\r\n * [For iOS](https://github.com/theGreatLzbdd/RevSTest-Objective-C)\r\n\r\n## P2P + Online Services,better together\r\nToday,most online services still use centralized servers,which is more expensive and easier to go down.P2P seems a much better approach.\r\nP2P can allow developers to build networks without centralized servers.\r\nIt has tons of advantages over centralized networks: **Less building cost,Less maintenance cost,More dynamic,Harder to go down** ,and more.\r\n\r\n * For individual developers,it can save butt loads of money,letting them innovate better.\r\n * For enterprises,they can throw away those gigantic servers,and keep only one or two small servers.\r\n * For users,adopting RevS means they can use the online services even when the servers are down.Amazing.  \r\n\r\nRevS can dramatically reduce the costs for online service developers.\r\n\r\n## Small learning curve\r\nBuilding an app using RevS is very similar to building Client-Server based apps.You can upload and download files just like interacting with a server.If you are familiar with building server based apps,you'd feel like you're home.\r\n\r\n## Build the future\r\nRevS now supports Mac/iOS apps.If you want to use RevS on other platforms,you can build your own implementation of RevS,using the language you prefer.View the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/theGreatLzbdd/RevS/wiki) to learn more.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
