================

RevS is an open source project that allows developers to build Peer-to-Peer based online services.

## P2P + Online Services,better together
Today,most online services still use centralized servers,which is more expensive and easier to go down.P2P seems a much better approach.
P2P can allow developers to build networks without centralized servers.
It has tons of advantages over centralized networks: **Less building cost,Less maintenance cost,More dynamic,Harder to go down** ,and more.

 * For individual developers,it can save butt loads of money,letting them innovate better.
 * For enterprises,they can throw away those gigantic servers,and keep only one or two small servers.
 * For users,adopting RevS means they can use the online services even when the servers are down.Amazing.  

RevS can dramatically reduce the costs for online service developers.

## Small learning curve
Building an app using RevS is very similar to building Client-Server based apps.You can upload and download files just like interacting with a server.If you are familiar with building server based apps,you'd feel like you're home.

## Build the future
RevS now supports Mac/iOS apps.If you want to use RevS on other platforms,you can build your own implementation of RevS,using the language you prefer.View the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/theGreatLzbdd/RevS/wiki) to learn more.
