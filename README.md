#Description

## P2P + Online Services,better together
Today,most online services still use centralized servers,which is more expensive and easier to go down.P2P seems a much better approach.
 * For individual developers,it can save butt loads of money,letting them innovate better.
 * For enterprises,they can throw away those gigantic servers,and keep only one or two small servers.
 * For users,adopting RevS means they can use the online services even when the servers are down.Amazing.  

RevS can dramatically reduce the costs for online service developers.

## P2P is just brilliant
Peer-to-Peer is a powerful technology that can allow developers to build networks without centralized servers.It has tons of advantages over centralized networks: **Less building cost,Less maintenance cost,More dynamic,Harder to go down** ,and more.

## Small learning curve
RevS offers an experience that is very similar to making Client-Server based apps.You can upload and download files just like interacting with a server.If you are familiar with building server based apps,you'd feel like you're home.
